The goal was to explore modern medicine, specifically medical marijuana. By finding new ways to invent and brand a conceptual company, a medical marijuana dispensary was created. Extensive research was conducted in the development of an infographic. This describes how the companies' supply chain would operate, the mechanical and operational functions of how raw materials are treated once they arrive on site, and how the promotional materials and finished products appear once packaged. From business cards to supply-chain management, CannaCo takes an in-depth look on how to create a medical dispensary in Chicago.",

The house was designed so that residents would have very specific routes when navigating the home. The lower level was set up so that the husband, also a doctor, could receive and treat his patients. The middle level contains all the residential living spaces, while the top level contains the bedrooms. Throughout these three levels, it is evident from the diagrams above that the house preferences the male as opposed to the female inhabitants.",
