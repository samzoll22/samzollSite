    description: "CannaCo is a further iteration of the Modern Pharmacy & Hospital of Chicago project, directed by studio Professor Sean Vance. The goal was to explore modern medicine, specifically medical marijuana. By finding new ways to invent and brand a conceptual company, a medical marijuana dispensary was created. Extensive research was conducted in the development of an infographic. This describes how the companies' supply chain would operate, the mechanical and operational functions of how raw materials are treated once they arrive on site, and how the promotional materials and finished products appear once packaged. From business cards to supply-chain management, CannaCo takes an in-depth look on how to create a medical dispensary in Chicago.",

  { title: 'Ann Arbor Music School',
    description: 'My second attempt to create The Ann Arbor School of Music was a much more successful pursuit as part of an exploration regarding how to design an educational environment conducive to music students. In this project, I designed a Music School that was focused on improving social interaction. The school is organized in a simple manner around two central helixes: one houses the classrooms and learning environments, while the other supports spaces designed for the students with individual and group learning pods where students can escape to practice music or study. The unique trait this building possesses is the ability to link any space to another through sound and light. If two students wanted to practice together, they could link their spaces for live audio feed, connecting two physically distant spaces in a way that feels as if they were joined. To add to this effect, lights would change color and intensity at the same rhythm or tempo to show visually that the spaces were connected. This highlights the internal connection to the exterior occupants of the surrounding building. Including this audio and visual communication aspect of this building allows students to enjoy privacy and personal space, while giving them the added benefit of being able to work on a group project or rehearse for an upcoming show in a collaborative manor. This form of Progressive Education embraces the ethos of our new generation and experiments with an alternative use of forward thinking technology.',

  { title: 'Ann Arbor Music School',
    description: "The Ann Arbor School of Music was part of an exploration that dealt with how to design an educational environment with preference to music students. Before the conceptual stage of design, I performed research delving into various ideologies and methods of education. The sociology and pedagogy of academia throughout history in our society focused my interest on the Progressive Education movement in the late 19th century and the Open Air Schools of the late 20's and 30's. John Dewey, one of the leaders of the Progressive Education movement, advocated for education that took into account the student’s status as a social being. Studying the Openluchtschool (Open Air School) in Amsterdam by Johannes Duiker helped me create a formal expression of how I designed division of space for the conception of this school. The project presented here was my first attempt at the formulation of a school. In the second iteration of this project, I was better able to clarify my aspirations regarding how I intended this School of Music to operate.",
